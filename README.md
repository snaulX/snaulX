## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am 17 y.o. programmer from Russia. I am owner of [Wings Studio](https://github.com/wings-studio).  
Recently I have been doing more closed-source programming. So my activity on GitHub can be very low.

#### I know:
* C/C++
* [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin) - one of my favourites languages
* [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) - one of my favourites languages
* Java - I dont like this language
* [Dart](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk)
* Python - I dont like this language
* JavaScript (HTML, CSS) - I dont like this language
* [Mash](https://github.com/RoPi0n/mash-lang)
* [OwnLang](https://github.com/aNNiMON/Own-Programming-Language-Tutorial)
* Pascal - I dont like this language
* [V](https://github.com/vlang/v)
* [Go](https://github.com/golang/go), [Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe), [wren](https://github.com/wren-lang/wren), [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), [Beef](https://github.com/beefytech/Beef), [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust), [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig) on small level of knowledge

#### I work on:
* SCP Deleted Chronicles - 3D first-person multiplayer RPG with elements of shooter. Im work how programmer.
* Enigma Labs - 3D puzzle game on [Flax Engine](https://github.com/FlaxEngine/FlaxEngine). *Wings Studio* project. If I finish Enigma Engine earlier then a game, game will continue developing using own engine.
* [Tangara](https://github.com/mino-lang/Tangara) - intermediate compilation platform for programming languages. Last work does mostly closed source.

#### Frozen for a while
* [Enigma.Window](https://github.com/wings-studio/Enigma.Window) - C library for work with different windowing and input libraries (GLFW, SDL2 and etc).

#### Also my toy renderers which I writing for learning purposes
* [ToyRendererDX11](https://github.com/snaulX/ToyRendererDX11) - toy renderer using Direct3D 11 and [Vortice.Windows](https://github.com/amerkoleci/Vortice.Windows) written on C#. **Not working.**
* [ToyRenderer_GL](https://github.com/snaulX/ToyRenderer_GL) - toy renderer using OpenGL and [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) written on C#.

#### My games:  
##### Old:
* [SCP snaulX Edition](https://github.com/snaulX/scp-snaulx-edition) - my 3D puzzle-game on Unity for OLD#48 (game jam). It was my first expirience in gamedev and Unity.
* [Heroes of Melitha](https://github.com/snaulX/Heroes-of-Melitha) - my 2D RPG on [KorGE](https://github.com/korlibs/korge) for KorJAM (it game jam too).
* Several small games that are at the bottom of my repos.  
 
#### Mino programming language
I made own compilable programming language with changable syntax named Mino. *Works only simple constructions.* I don't developing it now, progress has stopped a 2 years ago.
* [Mino](https://github.com/snaulX/Mino) - repo with all binaries, examples and description of the language.
* [TokensBuilder.NET](https://github.com/snaulX/TokensBuilder.NET) - backend of the compiler for .NET.
* [Tangara](https://github.com/snaulX/Tangara) - frontend of the compiler: lexer and parser.
 
#### My other projects:
* [RoadmapView](https://github.com/snaulX/RoadmapView) - customizable view for displaying roadmap in Android. Written on Kotlin.
* [Calculator](https://github.com/snaulX/Calculator) - calculator written in one week on Java using Swing. Maybe in future rewrite it on Kotlin.
* [WoL VM](https://github.com/snaulX/virtual-machine-dotnet) - my own virtual machine on .NET for future programming languages.
* [Visual Tokens](https://github.com/snaulX/visual-tokens) - my own visual programming environment on TornadoFX/Kotlin made for hackathon.
