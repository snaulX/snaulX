## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am 17 y.o. programmer from Russia. I am owner of [Wings Studio](https://github.com/wings-studio).  
Recently I have been doing more closed-source programming. So my activity on GitHub can be very low.

### I know:
#### Techs
* Gamedev - my main and favourite tech. Worked on [Unity](https://unity.com), [Flax](https://flaxengine.com/), [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [Stride](https://www.stride3d.net/), [Defold](https://github.com/defold/defold). Tried to do something on [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/), [Source](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source) (mod for hl2). 
* Android on Kotlin. Learning [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). Tried [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) but very little.
* Web. Backend: Node.js + Express, ASP.NET. Fornt-end: common HTML+CSS+JS (with jQuery).
* Desktop: Avalonia, WinForms, WPF, TornadoFx, Qt (C++).

#### Programming languages
* C/C++
* [Kotlin](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin)
* [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang)
* Java
* Python
* JavaScript (HTML, CSS)
* [V](https://github.com/vlang/v)
* [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
* [Lua](https://github.com/lua/lua)
* [Go](https://github.com/golang/go), [Haxe](https://github.com/HaxeFoundation/haxe), [wren](https://github.com/wren-lang/wren), [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript), [Beef](https://github.com/beefytech/Beef), [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig), [Dart](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk) on small level of knowledge

#### Gamedev skills
* Game-design - creating and working on games in *Wings Studio*.
* Level-design - I made some custom maps for HoMM 3. Also I have [uploads](https://steamcommunity.com/id/snaulX/myworkshopfiles/) in Steam workshop with maps for Portal 2 and CS:GO.
* Gameplay Programmer - first work in [SCP snaulX Edition](https://github.com/snaulX/scp-snaulx-edition) on Unity and [Heroes of Melitha](https://github.com/snaulX/Heroes-of-Melitha) on [KorGE](https://github.com/korlibs/korge) (*attention: I didn't refactor it and it was my first game, so shitty code and other stuff can spot there*). Now working in *Wings Studio* on **Enigma Labs** on Flax Engine.
* Network Programmer - working in *FreedomBay* on **SCP Deleted Chronicles** on Unity. Using/knowledge: custom TCP C# implementation, [Mirror](https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror), [Unity Netcode for GameObjects](https://unity.com/products/netcode).
* **Engine Developer** - main job/skill. Crafting own engine named Alpha Engine. Worked with a lot of engines before and read a lot of literature and posts about existing techs.

### I work on:
* [SCP Deleted Chronicles](https://fbay.space/) - 3D first-person multiplayer RPG with elements of shooter. Im work as programmer.
* [Tangara](https://github.com/mino-lang/Tangara) - intermediate compilation platform for programming languages. Last work does mostly closed source.
* Alpha Engine - own engine where all logic stored in different custom systems and engine just manipulating them. Using Tangara for load systems and call functions from them.
* Unannounced game - game in [Hades](https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/hades)-like style making on Alpha Engine.

### Frozen for a while
* [Enigma.Window](https://github.com/wings-studio/Enigma.Window) - C library for work with different windowing and input libraries (GLFW, SDL2 and etc).

#### Also my toy renderers which I wrote for learning purposes
* [ToyRendererDX11](https://github.com/snaulX/ToyRendererDX11) - toy renderer using Direct3D 11 and [Vortice.Windows](https://github.com/amerkoleci/Vortice.Windows) written on C#. **Not working.**
* [ToyRenderer_GL](https://github.com/snaulX/ToyRenderer_GL) - toy renderer using OpenGL and [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET) written on C#.

### My games:  
#### Old:
* [SCP snaulX Edition](https://github.com/snaulX/scp-snaulx-edition) - my 3D puzzle-game on Unity for OLD#48 (game jam). It was my first expirience in gamedev and Unity.
* [Heroes of Melitha](https://github.com/snaulX/Heroes-of-Melitha) - my 2D RPG on [KorGE](https://github.com/korlibs/korge) for KorJAM (it game jam too).
* [Beer Stranding](https://github.com/snaulX/Beer_Stranding) - joke 2D platformer on [Defold](https://github.com/defold/defold) for Ludum Dare 53 (was showed only in local subevent in Omsk).
* Several small games that are at the bottom of my repos.  
 
### Mino programming language
I made own compilable programming language with changable syntax named Mino. *Works only simple constructions.* I don't developing it now, progress has stopped a 2 years ago.
* [Mino](https://github.com/snaulX/Mino) - repo with all binaries, examples and description of the language.
* [TokensBuilder.NET](https://github.com/snaulX/TokensBuilder.NET) - backend of the compiler for .NET.
* [Tangara](https://github.com/snaulX/Tangara) - frontend of the compiler: lexer and parser.
 
### My other projects:
* SmartOffice - manage smart devices in your office from computer. Project divides on: [server](https://github.com/snaulX/SmartOffice_server) - server made on *Node.js+Express*, [client app](https://github.com/snaulX/SmartOffice_app) for managing devices (*C# & WPF*), [simulator](https://github.com/snaulX/SmartOffice_test) for simulate devices (*Java & JavaFx*). Made on hackathon in two days.
* [RoadmapView](https://github.com/snaulX/RoadmapView) - customizable view for displaying roadmap in Android. Written on Kotlin.
* [Calculator](https://github.com/snaulX/Calculator) - calculator written in one week on Java using Swing. Maybe in future rewrite it on Kotlin.
* [WoL VM](https://github.com/snaulX/virtual-machine-dotnet) - my own virtual machine on .NET for future programming languages.
* [Visual Tokens](https://github.com/snaulX/visual-tokens) - my own visual programming environment on TornadoFX/Kotlin made for hackathon.
* [C tasks - Camp August 2022](https://github.com/snaulX/c_tasks_camp) - tasks from learning C programming language and data structures (include binary heap) in camp in August 2022. Some simple tasks for learning C and data structures and own archiver using Huffman's algorithm.
