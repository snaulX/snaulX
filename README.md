## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am 18 y.o. programmer from Russia. Currently I am the student of SUAI in Saint-Petersburg and trying get into gamedev.  
Recently I have been doing more closed-source programming. So my activity on GitHub can be very low.

* Gameplay Programmer - first work in [SCP snaulX Edition](https://github.com/snaulX/scp-snaulx-edition) on Unity and [Heroes of Melitha](https://github.com/snaulX/Heroes-of-Melitha) on [KorGE](https://github.com/korlibs/korge) (*attention: I didn't refactor it and it was my first game, so shitty code and other stuff can spot there*). Now working in *Wings Studio* on unannounced project.

### My games:  
#### Old:
* [SCP snaulX Edition](https://github.com/snaulX/scp-snaulx-edition) - my 3D puzzle-game on Unity for Ludum Dare 45 (was showed only in local subevent in Omsk). It was my first expirience in gamedev and Unity.

* Several small games that are at the bottom of my repos.  
 
### Mino programming language
I made own compilable programming language with changable syntax named Mino. *Works only simple constructions.* I don't developing it now, progress has stopped a 3 years ago.
* [Mino](https://github.com/snaulX/Mino) - repo with all binaries, examples and description of the language.
