## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am 19 y.o. programmer from Russia. Currently I am working at Wargaming as Engine Developer in Serbia, Belgrade.
*Sometimes, I will remake this README, full of old and unrelated info, sometimes...*

### I know:
#### Techs
* *Gamedev* - my main and favourite tech. Worked on [Unity](https://unity.com), [Flax](https://flaxengine.com/), [Unigine](https://unigine.com/), [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), [Stride](https://www.stride3d.net/), [Defold](https://github.com/defold/defold). Tried to do something on [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/), [Source](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source) (mod for hl2). 
* *Android* on Kotlin. Learning [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose). Tried [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) but very little.
* *Web*. *Backend*: Node.js + Express, ASP.NET. *Front-end*: common HTML+CSS+JS (with jQuery).
* *Desktop*: WinForms, WPF, TornadoFx, Qt5/C++ and ready to learn something new.
* Had commerical experience of writing *Telegram bots* with [Telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon) and [peewee](https://github.com/coleifer/peewee) SQL ORM.

#### Gamedev skills/experience
* Level-design - I made some custom maps for HoMM 3. Also I have [uploads](https://steamcommunity.com/id/snaulX/myworkshopfiles/) in Steam workshop with maps for Portal 2 and CS:GO.
* Gameplay Programmer - first work in [SCP snaulX Edition](https://github.com/snaulX/scp-snaulx-edition) on Unity and [Heroes of Melitha](https://github.com/snaulX/Heroes-of-Melitha) on [KorGE](https://github.com/korlibs/korge) (*attention: I didn't refactor it and it was my first game, so shitty code and other stuff can spot there*).
* Network Programmer - crafting netcode in *Arcanica Interactive* for **SCP: Deleted Chronicles** on Unigine (previous on Unity). Using/knowledge: custom TCP C# implementation, [Mirror](https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror), [Unity Netcode for GameObjects](https://unity.com/products/netcode), custom Rust implementation using [renet](https://github.com/lucaspoffo/renet).
* UI Programmer - making UI system for **SCP: Deleted Chronicles**. Made system/library for programmers to easy load and manipulate UI from assets and in the game. Made easy-to-use tools for designers to make UI, import to in-game assets and checking it in the game/engine/editor.
* Tools Programmer - I developed *Editor layer* - layer that communicates between game/editor and external tools, which makes creating assets and debugging much easier, using C++ with [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) for **SCP: Deleted Chronicles** to use in Unigine. Also I wrote some custom tools using this editor layer and Qt5/C++ for this game & engine too.
* **Engine Developer** - main job/skill. Crafting own engine named Alpha Engine. Worked with a lot of engines before and read a lot of literature and posts about existing techs.
* Other programmer experience: developed many systems in *Arcanica Interactive* for **SCP: Deleted Chronicles** on Unigine using CMake/C++. This includes *Network system*, *UI system* (read about both of it higher), *Lua system* - for integrating [luau](https://luau-lang.org/) into project and having easy access to it in any part of the engine.

### I work on:
* [SCP: Deleted Chronicles](https://arcanica-interactive.com/?page=main&lang=en) - 3D first-person multiplayer RPG with elements of shooter. Made in Unigine. I'm work as network/systems/ui programmer but also participate in many other sides of development.
* [Tangara](https://github.com/snaulX/Tangara) ([previous version](https://github.com/snaulX/Tangara_old)) - library for easy interop between different programming languages.
* Alpha Engine - own engine where all logic stored in different custom systems and engine just manipulating them. Using Tangara for load systems and call functions from them.

### Contributed to:
* Some README-only repos like [public_source_engines](https://github.com/redorav/public_source_engines), [awesomo](https://github.com/lk-geimfari/awesomo), [awesome-rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust)
* Added flags to control hot keys for NativeApp in [DiligentTools](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentTools)

### My games:  
#### Old:
* [SCP snaulX Edition](https://github.com/snaulX/scp-snaulx-edition) - my 3D puzzle-game on Unity for Ludum Dare 45 (was showed only in local subevent in Omsk). It was my first expirience in gamedev and Unity.
* [Heroes of Melitha](https://github.com/snaulX/Heroes-of-Melitha) - my 2D RPG on [KorGE](https://github.com/korlibs/korge) for KorJAM (game jam for KorGE engine).
* Several small games that are at the bottom of my repos.  
 
### Mino programming language
I made own compilable programming language with changable syntax named Mino. *Works only simple constructions.* I don't developing it now, progress has stopped a 4 years ago.
* [Mino](https://github.com/snaulX/Mino) - repo with all binaries, examples and description of the language.
* [TokensBuilder.NET](https://github.com/snaulX/TokensBuilder.NET) - backend of the compiler for .NET.
* [Tangara](https://github.com/snaulX/Mino_Tangara) - frontend of the compiler: lexer and parser.
